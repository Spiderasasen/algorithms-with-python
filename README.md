# algorithms-with-python
using as many algorithms as i can remember and having it have a visualizer and maybe a graph visual. 

# Sorting Algorithms
I'll be adding all sorting algorithms that i learned in class, and also have it in a visualizer format.
This wa,y I will see how long each algorithm takes and also which is better when needed.

# Graph Theory
Very interesting concept, but idk if i can write it. Due to my needing to figure out how to add a visualizer for a graph as well, but i have the determination to do it.
