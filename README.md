# algorithms-with-python
using as many algorithms as i can remember and having it have a visualizer and maybe a graph visual. 

# Sorting Algorithms
I'll be adding all sorting algorithms that i learned in class, and also have it in a visualizer format.
This way, I will see how long each algorithm takes and also which is better when needed.

# key points
Some things that i never knew were that i had to actually learn were how coding a mini type of website, or just a control panel, on Python was going to work. from having simple items like adding a button and also a title, to adding a scroll bar, adding a canvas with colors, where going to be more complicated than expected. 

# future algorithms?
Right now there are some simple algoriths, ([coming from this website]([url](https://www.wscubetech.com/resources/dsa/sorting-algorithms))), which is no a lot but really impresive for like a week with a code of with all the differnt codeing algorithms. Im more then happy to add some simple items like some graph theory items, but also other items. 

# Is this good for my class?
Well, i learnt most of these in theory, but actually coding it is more impressive than just seeing the idea of it. This will be used as a resource for me or another future resource that i might need in the future.
